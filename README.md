# LAION-dataset-mathematical-equations
Hello, here is my first project at LAION.  This project randomly creates mathematical equations.  The dataset consists of an image (jpg) and a text (txt). On the image you can see a simple mathematical equation. In the text is the answer. With this dataset it is possible to create an AI that can recognize and solve mathematical equations on an image.  Have fun!
